# News-Search-and-Summarization-Model
A command-line tool that searches for recent news on a user-defined topic, saves articles in a CSV file, provides summaries, and extracts named entities from titles. It supports English and German, with auto-translation to German if German articles are unavailable. The tool uses APIs to retrieve, summarize, translate, and analyze news content.
